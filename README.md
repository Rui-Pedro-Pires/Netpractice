# Net_Practice

## Overview

This project allowed me to dive into the fundamentals of networking by solving practical exercises involving small-scale network configurations. The goal was to fix broken network setups and make them functional, all while understanding how TCP/IP addressing works.

## What I Did

I completed 10 different levels, each presenting a non-functioning network diagram. My task was to diagnose and solve the issues to ensure the network ran properly. For each level, I adjusted the configuration, verified my solution, and exported my work once the network was functioning.

## Key Learning Points

- I gained a deeper understanding of **TCP/IP addressing** and how different network devices, like routers, operate.
- The project honed my skills in diagnosing network problems and applying proper configurations.
- Working through the levels gave me hands-on practice with network setups, which will be crucial in system administration roles.
